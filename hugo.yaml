    Content: |
      I’ve been to a lot of places and picked up plenty of stories along the way.  
      Some memories still make me laugh, others just make me think.  
      I’m sharing a few here — maybe they’ll inspire you, or just keep you company.  
      Let’s see where these stories take us next.
